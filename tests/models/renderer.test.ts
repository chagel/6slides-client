     * The renderer handles slides with subslides by creating a nested structure:
     * 
     * 1. When a slide has subslides:
     *    - Create a parent <section> element
     *    - Within it, create a child <section> for the main slide content
     *    - For each subslide, create another child <section>
     * 
     * 2. When a slide doesn't have subslides:
     *    - Create a single <section> element with the slide content
     * 
     * 3. The detection logic:
     *    - Check if slide.subslides exists and is an array with length > 0
     *    - If true, create nested structure
     *    - If false, create simple slide
     * 
     * This implementation follows the reveal.js pattern for vertical slides,
     * which uses nested sections to represent vertical slide relationships.
